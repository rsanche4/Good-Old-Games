Welcome to Blackjack!
To play just double click blackjack.py and 
you are ready to go!

This was a very cool project for learning more about
Python.

I hope you enjoy! Oh, and here are the rules for 
blackjack as a reminder:

1. Once you see your cards, you can either HIT or
STAND. If you hit, you draw a new card. If you stand
the game moves on to the dealer's turn.

2. When the dealer plays, they turn up one of their
faced down card and start drawing cards from the deck.
If their score is 17 or above, they stop drawing
cards from the deck.

3. Then, if no one went above 21, we check who is
closer when we add up their cards. If the player's
cards added up are closer to 21, then the player wins,
otherwise the dealer wins. If it's a tie, then no one
wins.

And that's it! Have fun!
