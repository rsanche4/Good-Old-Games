BITLAND
By @rsanche4

A Simple Rogue-like RPG for the Linux Terminal.

To run it, go to the terminal and use the
command 'cd' to enter in the BITLAND folder.

To make sure you are there, you can type 'ls'
to see all the files inside the folder.

To run the game, type 'make' in the terminal
to make the executable.

After this, type './main' and the game should
start.

GUIDE

This game has simple mechanics.
Food is represented as a '&' in the map.

Finding food will increase your food supply.
Pressing 'e' will allow you to eat!
Note that sometimes you find empty sacks,
even if it appears on the map.
In that case, your food supply will not
increase.

w - a - s - d is for movement.
Make sure you don't have CAPS ON!

A village always has food available, and your
health will max out when in a village!
You can find villages every 5 levels.

In every maze, you will randomly encounter
a variety of enemies. So be careful!

Finding '*' in a maze will allow you to move
up a level, increasing your stats as well.

Try to make it to level 61 and defeat the
boss!

If your hp drops to 0 in a battle, you
will die... and will have to restart.

Play wisely, brave player!
Good luck!
