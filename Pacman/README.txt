#Pac-Man is a 1980 maze action video game developed and#        
#released by Namco for arcades.                        #      
#The original Japanese title of Puck Man was changed to#       
#Pac-Man for international releases as a preventative  #        
#measure against defacement of the arcade machines by  #     
#changing the P to an F.                               #        
#In North America, the game was released by Midway     #      
#Manufacturing as part of its licensing agreement      #       
#with Namco America.                                   #      
#                                                      #      
#Here is a tribute to the classic game!                #      
#                                                      #      
#These are the rules:                                  #       
#The objective of the game is to eat all of the dots   #       
#placed in the maze while avoiding four colored ghosts #      
#— Blinky (red), Pinky (pink), Inky (cyan), and Clyde  #      
#(orange) — that pursue him. When Pac-Man eats all of  #     
#the dots, the player advances to the next level.      #      
#If Pac-Man makes contact with a ghost, he will lose a #      
#life; the game ends when all lives are lost.          #        
#                                                      #
